Yet another pandemic model
==========================

The state of NSW was doing really well in controlling Covid. Better than
Victoria, which is what we care about.

And then, with a change of premier and a change of policy and the rise of
the omicron variant, things started going south somewhat. And south is
where Victoria is, so we don't want that.

Anyway, I scheduled *cronscript.sh* to run every day, and that commits
the latest data as an image into the repo. Maybe one day I'll do some
fancier automated data journalism; but if I do I probably need to be
nice to Anthony Macali (who lives in Victoria, poor guy) on whose
data scraping this whole system works.

Have a look at the (output/)[output/] folder for today's latest.
It gets updated around 10:30am each day.
